# QTI converter

This program will convert a simply formatted text (.txt or .md) document containing most question types available in Canvas into a zip file that can be imported to Canvas to add the questions to a question bank or as a quiz.
This is updated to work with some of the more modern formats of questions available in "New Quizzes" like "hotspot" and "categorization". It *should* still be backward compatible with classic quizzes as long as you stick to question types found there. 

NOTE: With the classic quizzes Canvas import process will also make an actual quiz containing all of the questions in the bank. If you just want the question bank to pull from, I suggest deleting that quiz after import.
