# QTI Converter Report Feature

The QTI Converter now automatically generates a comprehensive report each time you convert a text file to QTI format. This report provides valuable insights about your question bank and helps identify potential issues.

## Report Location

The report is saved as a text file in the same directory as your input file with the naming convention:
